To run the state machine, type the following command:

"node main.js <path_to_flows_directory>"

For example:

"node main.js ./flows"

The log can be seen at the console (stdout).

To move the state machine log (stdout) to log file, type the following command:

"node main.js <path_to_flows_directory> > log.txt 2>&1"

For example:

"node main.js ./flows > log.txt 2>&1"

Good Luck:)
