Running as follows in command line:

node main.js <path_to_flows_directory>

For example:

node main.js ./folows

The log shows on console (stdout).

If you want the log into a log file, you should executing the state machine as follows:

node main.js <path_to_flows_directory> > log.txt 2>&1

Good Luck:)
