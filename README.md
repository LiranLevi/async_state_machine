Running as follows in command line:

"node main.js <path_to_flows_directory>"

For example:

"node main.js ./flows"

The log shows on console (stdout).

If you want the log into a log file, you should executing the state machine as follows:

"node main.js <path_to_flows_directory> > log.txt 2>&1"

For example:

"node main.js ./flows"

Good Luck:)
